# Skyhook

Cross-platform (React Native) app for booking plane tickets. Merely a proof-of-concept achieved through a
custom backend that provides plane and ticket data.

## Functional requirements

- List all applicable flights for a given destination
- Purchase tickets (although without an actual payment system)
- Get an overview of all booked flights, being able to cancel them when applicable
